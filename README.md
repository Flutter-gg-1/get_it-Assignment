# Twitter-like Flutter App

This is a simple Flutter application that mimics a basic Twitter-like functionality. The app allows users to add tweets, display them on the home screen, and delete them if needed. The app also demonstrates the use of `Get It` for dependency injection and `Get Storage` for local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tweets**: Users can add new tweets through a simple text field.
- **Display Tweets**: Tweets are displayed on the home screen in a list format.
- **Delete Tweets**: Users can delete individual tweets from the list.
- **Local Storage**: The app uses `Get Storage` to store tweets locally on the device.
